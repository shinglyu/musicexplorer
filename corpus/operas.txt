    1607 L'Orfeo (Claudio Monteverdi). This is widely regarded as the first operatic masterwork.[1]
    1640 Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (Monteverdi). Monteverdi's first opera for Venice, based on Homer's Odyssey, displays the composer's mastery of portrayal of genuine individuals as opposed to stereotypes.[2]
    1642 L'incoronazione di Poppea (Monteverdi). Monteverdi's last opera, composed for a Venetian audience, is often performed today. Its Venetian context helps to explain the complete absence of the moralizing tone often associated with opera of this time.[2]
    1644 Ormindo (Francesco Cavalli). One of the first of Cavalli's operas to be revived in the 20th century, Ormindo is considered one of his more attractive works.[2]
    1649 Giasone (Cavalli). In Giasone Cavalli, for the first time, separated aria and recitative.[2] Giasone was the most popular opera of the 17th century.[3]
    1651 La Calisto (Cavalli). The ninth of the eleven operas that Cavalli wrote with Faustini is noted for its satire of the deities of classical mythology.[4]
    1683 Dido and Aeneas (Henry Purcell). Often considered to be the first genuine English-language operatic masterwork. Not first performed in 1689 at a girls' school, as is commonly believed, but at Charles II's court in 1683.[5]
    1692 The Fairy-Queen (Purcell). A semi-opera rather than a genuine opera, this is often thought to be Purcell's finest dramatic work.[5]

1700–1749

    1710 Agrippina (Handel). Handel's last opera that he composed in Italy was a great success,[6] and established his reputation as a composer of Italian opera.[7]

    1724 Giulio Cesare (Handel). This Handel opera is noted for the richness of its orchestration.[7]
    1724 Tamerlano (Handel). This work is described by Anthony Hicks, writing in Grove Music Online, as possessing a "taut dramatic power".[7]
    1725 Rodelinda (Handel). Rodelinda is often praised for the fullness of the melodic writing among Handel's output.[7]
    1728 The Beggar's Opera (Johann Christoph Pepusch). A satire of Italian opera seria based on a play by John Gay, the ballad opera format of The Beggar's Opera has proved popular even up to the current time.[8]
    1731 Acis and Galatea (Handel). This is Handel's only work for the theatre that is set to an English libretto.[9]
    1733 Orlando (Handel). An opera that is described by Anthony Hicks as "remarkable" [7] and by Orrey as one of Handel's "best works".[9]

    1738 Serse (Handel). A deviation from the usual model of opera seria, Serse contains many comic elements rare in Handel's other works.[7]
    1744 Semele (Handel). Originally performed as an oratorio, Semele's dramatic qualities have often led to the work being performed on the opera stage in modern times.[12]
    1745 Platée (Rameau). Rameau's most famous comic opera. Originally a court entertainment, a 1754 revival proved extremely popular with French audiences.[11]

1750–1799

    1787 Don Giovanni (Mozart). The second of the operas that Mozart set to Da Ponte's libretti, Don Giovanni has provided a puzzle for writers and philosophers ever since its composition.[16]
    1790 Così fan tutte (Mozart). The third and last of the operas that Mozart set to libretti by Da Ponte, Così fan tutte was scarcely performed throughout the 19th century, as the plot was considered to be immoral.[24]
    1791 La clemenza di Tito (Mozart). Mozart's last opera before his early death was extremely popular until 1830, after which the work's popularity and critical reputation began to decline; they did not return to their former levels until after the Second World War.[16]
    1791 Die Zauberflöte (Mozart). A work that has been described as "the apotheosis of the Singspiel", Die Zauberflöte was denigrated during the 19th century as confused and lacking in definition.[25]
    1792 Il matrimonio segreto (Domenico Cimarosa). Usually regarded as Cimarosa's best opera,[26] Leopold II enjoyed the three-hour-long premiere so much that, after dinner, he compelled the singers to repeat the opera later during that same day.[27]
    1797 Médée (Luigi Cherubini). The only French opera of the Revolutionary period to be regularly performed today. A famous showcase for sopranos such as Maria Callas.[28]

    1805 Fidelio (Ludwig van Beethoven). Beethoven's only opera was inspired by the composer's passion for political liberty.[29]
    1807 La vestale (Gaspare Spontini). Spontini's opera about a vestal virgin in love was a great influence on Berlioz and a forerunner of French grand opera.[30]
    1812 La scala di seta (Gioachino Rossini). An early Rossini work, this opera is outright farsa comica.[31]

    1816 Otello (Rossini). The composer Giacomo Meyerbeer described the third act of Otello thus: "The third act of Otello established its reputation so firmly that a thousand errors could not shake it".[31]
    1817 La Cenerentola (Rossini). Rossini's comedy was composed in just over three weeks.[31]
    1817 La gazza ladra (Rossini). In this opera Rossini drew upon French rescue opera.[31]

    1827 Il pirata (Vincenzo Bellini). Bellini's second professional production established his international reputation.[36]

    1828 Le comte Ory (Rossini). Rossini's opera has enjoyed a high critical reputation throughout the years: 19th-century critic Henry Chorley said that "there is not a bad melody, there is not an ugly bar in Le comte Ory", and Richard Osborne, writing in Grove Music Online, calls details that the work is one of the "wittiest, most stylish and most urbane of all comic operas".[31]
    1829 La straniera (Bellini). La straniera is rare among bel canto operas in that it offers remarkably few opportunities for vocal ostentation.[36]
    1829 William Tell (Rossini). Rossini's last opera before his retirement is a tale of liberty set in the Swiss Alps. It helped to establish the genre of French Grand Opera.[38]

    1847 Macbeth (Verdi). Verdi's first venture into Shakespeare.[69]
    1847 Martha (Friedrich von Flotow). Flotow unashamedly aimed at satisfying popular taste in this comic and sentimental work set in the England of Queen Anne.[71]

    1849 Le prophète (Meyerbeer). A grand opera about the life of the religious fanatic, John of Leiden.[73]

    1858 Der Barbier von Bagdad (Peter Cornelius). An oriental comedy drawing on the tradition of German Romantic opera.[82]

    1859 Faust (Charles Gounod). Of all the musical settings of the Faust legend, Gounod's has been the most popular with audiences, especially in the Victorian era.[84]
    1859 Un ballo in maschera (Verdi). By the time he came to write Un ballo in maschera, Verdi was rich enough not to have to work for a living. This opera ran into trouble with the censors because it originally dealt with the assassination of a monarch.[85]
    1862 Béatrice et Bénédict (Berlioz). The last opera Berlioz wrote is the fruit of his lifelong admiration for Shakespeare.[86]
    1862 La forza del destino (Verdi). This tragedy was commissioned by the Imperial Theatre, Saint Petersburg, and Verdi may have been influenced by the Russian tradition in the writing of his work.[87]

    1865 Tristan und Isolde (Wagner). This romantic tragedy is Wagner's most radical work and one of the most revolutionary pieces in music history. The "Tristan chord" began the breakdown of traditional tonality.[92]
    1866 Mignon (Ambroise Thomas). A lyrical work inspired by Goethe's novel Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, this was Thomas's most successful opera along with Hamlet.[93]
    1866 The Bartered Bride (Bedřich Smetana). Smetana's folk comedy is the most widely performed of all his operas.[94]

    1874 Boris Godunov (Modest Mussorgsky). Mussorgsky's great historical drama shows Russia's descent into anarchy in the early 17th century.[105]

    1877 Samson and Delilah (Camille Saint-Saëns). An opera with that was heavily influenced by those of Wagner.[112]
    1879 Eugene Onegin (Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky). Tchaikovsky's most popular opera, based on the verse novel by Alexander Pushkin. The composer strongly identified with the heroine Tatyana.[113]
